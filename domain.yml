  utter_battery_definition:
  - text: |
      Battery is a collection of one or more cells whose chemical reactions create a flow of electrons in a circuit. 
      All batteries are made up of three basic components: 
        an anode (the '-' side), 
        a cathode (the '+' side) and 
        some kind of electrolyte (a substance that chemically reacts with the anode and cathode)

  - text: I am doing great. Thanks for asking.
  - text: Great, how about you?
  - text: Just chilling. How about you?
  utter_thermal_management:
  - text: The temperature management inside the battery is called thermal management. Its function is to equalize and keep the temperature of the battery cells within a reasonable range.
  utter_how_thermal_management:
  - text: Thermal management can be done by enforcing cooling on high temperature batteries and heating batteries in low temperature conditions.
  utter_thermal_management_importance:
  - text: Both the higher and lower temperature environments will seriously affect the battery capacity and the service life.
  utter_batt_at_high_temperature:
  - text: At a high temperature environment, lithium-ion batteries may produce thermal runaway, resulting in short circuits, combustion, explosion and other safety problems.
  utter_thermal_runaway:
  - text: Thermal runaway is a chain reaction within a battery cell that can be very difficult to stop once it has started.
  utter_thermal_runaway_trigger:
  - text: It occurs when the temperature inside a battery reaches the point that causes a chemical reaction to occur inside the battery. This chemical reaction produces even more heat, which drives the temperature higher, causing further chemical reactions that create more heat.
  utter_thermal_runaway_danger:
  - text: In thermal runaway, the battery cell temperature rises incredibly fast, usually in milliseconds. The energy stored in that battery is released very suddenly. This chain reaction creates extremely high temperatures of around 752 degrees Fahrenheit or 400 degrees Celsius. These temperatures can cause gassing of the battery and a fire that is so hot it can be nearly impossible to extinguish.
  utter_thermal_runaway_damage:
  - text: In extreme cases, thermal runaway can cause batteries to explode and start fires. In minor cases, it can cause batteries to melt or be damaged beyond repair.
  utter_thermal_runaway_cause:
  - text: Thermal runaway can occur due to an internal short circuit caused by physical damage or poor battery maintenance. The same type of scenario could cause an external short circuit which could also kick off the chain reaction. Also, Overcharging a battery beyond its safe max voltage can permanently damage it and lead to thermal runaway.
  utter_low_temperature_impact:
  - text: Lithium dendrites may appear in lithium-ion batteries at low temperature, causing short circuits, failure to start and other operational faults.
  utter_lithium_dendrites:
  - text: Lithium dendrites are metallic microstructures that form on the negative electrode during the charging process.
  utter_lithium_dendrites_formation:
  - text: Lithium dendrites are formed when extra lithium ions accumulate on the anode surface and cannot be absorbed into the anode in time.
  utter_lithium_dendrites_impact:
  - text: They can cause short circuits and lead to catastrophic failures and even fires. In addition, capacity fade is another potential hazard of lithium dendrite growth.
  utter_anode_negative_electrode_difference:
  - text: Anode and negative electrodes are one and the same
  utter_capacity_fade_dendrite:
  - text: The lithium dendrite reacts with the electrolyte, causing it to decompose and triggering the loss of active lithium inside the battery. The capacity loss is an accumulating effect along with the gradual lithium dendrite growth.
  utter_lithium_dendrite_formation_factors:
  - text: Lithium dendrite growth is influenced by multiple parameters, including current density, temperature, electrolyte, and electrolyte convection.
  utter_li_negative_electrode:
  - text: Carbon is used to make the negative electrode.
  utter_li_positive_electrode:
  - text: Lithium-containing compounds are used to make the positive electrode.
  utter_positive_electrode_types:
  - text: The chemical composition of some of the positive electrodes is LiFePO4, LiMn2O4 and Li(NiCoMn)O2.
  utter_heat_source_li:
  - text: 'There are four primary sources of heat inside a battery: the reaction heat from a reversible reaction; the by-reaction heat generated by electrolyte decomposition during overcharging or over-discharge; joule heat due to the internal resistance of the cell; and the heat of polarization caused by the polarization reaction.'
  utter_polarization_reaction:
  - text: In electrochemistry, polarization is a collective term for certain mechanical side-effects (of an electrochemical process) by which isolating barriers develop at the interface between electrode and electrolyte.
  utter_current_impact_on_battery_capacity:
  - text: The larger the discharge current of the battery, the smaller the discharge capacity and the faster the voltage drop. When the charging current increases, the charging speed increases, and the more heat a battery generates.
  utter_battery_operating_limit:
  - text: The common operating temperature of LIBs is usually between 15 °C and 40 °C.
  utter_low_temp_impact:
  - text: The performance of LIBs can be problematic at low temperatures (e.g., <15 °C). The charging and discharging performance will be affected because the electrochemical reaction cannot be carried out normally.
  utter_electrochemical_rk_low_temperature:
  - text: When the temperature is too low, the diffusion rate of lithium-ions in the electrolyte decreases seriously due to the increase of electrolyte viscosity, resulting in a significant rise in the internal resistance.
  utter_li_ion_diffusion_rate_impact_battery_capacity:
  - text: The number of lithium-ions participating in the reaction decreases, directly affecting the electricity storage and release, leading to the attenuation of battery capacity and power characteristics.
  utter_low_temp_charging:
  - text: For the charging of LIBs at low temperature, lithium dendrites may pierce the film, forming an internal short circuit and threatening the safety of use
  utter_high_temperature_impact:
  - text: 'LIB pack is composed of many single LIBs in series or in parallel, so the heat generated by the electrochemical reaction of the battery itself cannot be released in time due to the high environment temperature when the battery pack undergoes charging or discharging.'
  utter_internal_temperature_rise:
  - text: A single battery cell may be overheated, resulting in the combustion, explosion, or escape of toxic gases. Moreover, the short circuit may occur at high temperatures due to the LIB pack's complicated internal power circuit structure.
  utter_gas_released_internal_temperature_rise:
  - text: Gases which can be released as a result of internal temperature rise are CO, C2H4, H2S, HF.
  utter_high_temperature_impact_capacity_loss:
  - text: High temperatures also affect the capacity of LIBs. Studies have shown that LIBs lose nearly 70 % of their capacity after 500 cycles of discharging at 55 °C.
  utter_maintain_internal_temperature:
  - text: In cold regions, the battery's internal temperature is maintained by heating. In hot regions, the temperature is maintained by cooling.
  utter_heating_technique:
  - text: 'The heating methods for LIBs can be divided into the following categories: electric heating, air heating, liquid heating, PCM heating, and other heating methods such as the Peltier effect and heat pipe.'
  utter_cooling_technique:
  - text: Different methods exist, including air cooling, liquid cooling and PCM cooling technologies.
  utter_common_cooling_technique:
  - text: Air cooling is the most widely used heat dissipation method for battery packs by directly using the wind around the moving car to conduct natural convection or generate forced airflow through the fan operation.
  utter_PCM_full_form:
  - text: PCM stand for Phase Change Material
  utter_PCM_working:
  - text: Phase change material (PCM) are substances that absorb and release thermal energy during the process of melting and solidifying. When a PCM melts, it absorbs a large amount of heat (energy) from the environment. Conversely, when a PCM solidifies it releases a large amount of energy in the form of latent heat.
  utter_PCM_types:
  - text: Natural convection has the apparent advantages of simplicity and low cost, while it also has the disadvantage of weak heat dissipation capacity due to uncontrollable wind.
  utter_best_PCM:
  - text: The most cost-effective PCM for energy storage is the Paraffin wax.
  utter_PCM_quality_factors:
  - text: There are several factors that need to be considered when selecting a phase change material. An ideal PCM will have high heat of fusion, high thermal conductivity, high specific heat and density, long term reliability during repeated cycling, and dependable freezing behaviour.
  utter_PCM_safety:
  - text: All PCMs are Non-Toxic and Non-Hazardous. Therefore, PCM are safe
  utter_tradeoff_natural_convection:
  - text: Natural convection has the apparent advantages of simplicity and low cost, while it also has the disadvantage of weak heat dissipation capacity due to uncontrollable wind.
  utter_tradeoff_air_cooling:
  - text: Natural convection has the apparent advantages of simplicity and low cost, while it also has the disadvantage of weak heat dissipation capacity due to uncontrollable wind.
  utter_tradeoff_forced_convection:
  - text: The forced convection by the fan is more reliable and easier to maintain than natural convection, therefore becoming a more common battery cooling method. However, a common problem for forced convection is the temperature non-uniformity within the cell.
  utter_liquid_cooling:
  - text: Liquid cooling system has four parts, condenser, evaporator, compressor and liquid coolant. The liquid coolant flows through the battery pack, extracts the heat, and maintains temperature.
  utter_liquid_cool_or_air_cool:
  - text: Compared with air cooling, liquid cooling is more efficient due to the higher heat transfer coefficient of water.
  utter_liquid_cooling_methods:
  - text: Liquid cooling can be classified into direct cooling and indirect cooling.
  utter_direct_liquid_cooling:
  - text: Direct cooling (such as liquid immersion cooling) can cool the entire battery surface, which greatly contributes to the temperature uniformity of LIBs.
  utter_direct_liquid_cooling_in_auto:
  - text: Direct contact liquid cooling is not common in automobile battery cooling systems due to its high requirement on the waterproof performance of battery system, and electrical short circuit and electrochemical reaction may occur.
  utter_indirect_cooling_methods:
  - text: Indirect liquid cooling includes techniques such as tube cooling, cold plate cooling with mini/microchannels, jacket cooling, etc.
  utter_direct_indirect_cooling_eff:
  - text: Direct method has the higher efficiency.
  utter_why_indirect_cooling_low_eff:
  - text: The loss of efficiency in the indirect method is due to the resistance to heat transfer between the pipe containing the cooling liquid and the cell itself.
  utter_common_liquids_for_cooling:
  - text: Water, deionized water, glycol/water solutions and dielectric fluids such as fluorocarbons and PAO(Polyalphaolefin) are the heat transfer fluids commonly used in liquid cooling applications.
  utter_li_operating_temp:
  - text: The ideal operating temperature is between 16 and 25 degrees Celsius.
  utter_can_battery_refrigerant_used:
  - text: Yes, Refrigerant can be used. It is called Direct refrigerant cooling (DRC).
  utter_DRC:
  - text: Similar to active liquid cooling, DRS consists of an air conditioning loop with the refrigerant as a heat transfer fluid circulating throughout the battery pack.
  utter_LIB_full_form:
  - text: LIB stands for lithium-ion batteries.
  utter_ESS_full_form:
  - text: ESS is the short form of Energy Storage System
  utter_causes_of_fault:
  - text: The battery faults can be triggered by mechanical abuse, electrical abuse, thermal abuse, and ageing or degradation.
  utter_cathode_materials:
  - text: According to the structures, the cathode materials can be divided into three classes, i.e., layered oxides, spinel oxides, and polyanion oxides.
  utter_layered_oxides:
  - text: Layered oxides are mainly lithium metal oxides (LiMO2 where M represents metal elements including Ni, Co and Mn).
  utter_tradeoff_layered_oxides:
  - text: The layered oxides give the highest practical capacity but suffer from structural and chemical instabilities.
  utter_different_layered_oxide_cathodes:
  - text: The layered lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2, LCO) is the first oxide cathode investigated in LIBs. The other layered cathodes are lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (LiNi1-y-zCoyMnzO2, NCM) and lithium nickel cobalt aluminium oxide (LiNi1-y-zCoyAlzO2, NCA).
  utter_cathode_in_EV_battery:
  - text: NCM is now one of the most widely used cathode materials for LIBs in EVs due to its high energy density and low price.
  utter_NCM_cathode_composition:
  - text: The proportion of Ni, Co and Mn (i.e., the value of y and z in LiNi1-y-zCoyMnzO2) in NCM is a balance among chemical stability, structural stability, electrical conductivity, abundance of materials.
  utter_tradeoff_nickel_cobalt_manganese:
  - text: Co has higher electronic conductivity and lower resistance, resulting in excellent power performance. But Co is more toxic and more expensive than Ni and Mn.
  utter_pros_cons_manganese:
  - text: Among Ni, Co and Mn, Mn is the most abundant and thus the cheapest. Moreover, Mn has better chemical stability involving oxygen release from the lattice than Ni and Co.
  utter_pros_cons_nickel:
  - text: Ni offers reasonably good structural stability and high capacity but low stability. There is a trend to increase the Ni proportion and decrease the Co proportion in NCM such that the capacity of LIB can be increased and the cost can be cut down. However, this is at the expense of thermal stability reduction, which increases the risk of safety problems.
  utter_ratio_NiCoMn_commercial_cathodes:
  - text: The ratio (1-y-z):y:z in LiNi_1-y-zCoyMnzO2 in the commercial NCM cathode can be 1/3:1/3:1/3, 0.5:0.2:0.3, 0.6:0.2:0.2, 0.70:0.15:0.15, 0.8:0.1:0.1 and 0.85:0.075:0.075.
  utter_spinel_oxide_cathode_examples:
  - text: The most typical representative of spinel oxides is lithium manganese oxide (LiMn2O4, LMO).
  utter_polyanion_oxide_cathode_examples:
  - text: Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4, LFP) is the most common polyanion oxide cathode.
  utter_common_anode_material:
  - text: The commonplace commercial anode material includes carbonaceous materials and lithium titanate (Li4Ti5O12, LTO).
  utter_carbonaceous_anode_types:
  - text: According to the structures and the electrochemical properties, the carbonaceous materials can be categorized in different forms, including graphite, soft carbon (such as coke or carbon black) and hard carbon.
  utter_SEI_layer:
  - text: SEI stands for Solid Electrolyte Interphase.
  utter_SEI_layer_thickness:
  - text: A stable Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) layer has thickness between 10 and 100 nm.
  utter_SEI_composition:
  - text: SEI is mainly composed of (CH2OCO2Li)2, LiCH2CH2OCO2Li, CH3OCO2Li, LiOH, Li2CO3, LiF.
  utter_SEI_characteristics:
  - text: The SEI film is a passivation layer which prevents the anode from further reacting with the electrolyte but increases the internal resistance of LIBs, causing larger polarization during the intercalation/deintercalation of li-ions.
  utter_LCO_full_form:
  - text: LCO stands for lithium, cobalt, oxide.
  utter_LCO_chemical_formula:
  - text: The chemical formula for LCO is LiCoO2

  utter_overcharge_cause:
  - text: Overcharge may result from inconsistency of LIB cells in the system, malfunction of battery charger, incorrect voltage and/or current measurement, or inaccurate SOC estimation by battery management system (BMS).
  utter_overcharge_outcome:
  - text: During overcharge, it becomes difficult for li-ions to insert into the anode since it is over-lithiated. Filling a battery beyond full state-of-charge turns excess energy into heat and gas. With Li-ion, this can result in a deposit of unwanted materials. Prolonged over-charge causes permanent damage.
  utter_over_lithiation_impact:
  - text: Due to over-lithiation metallic lithium may deposit on the anode surface and propagate in dendrite-like (also called lithium plating) or fibre-like shapes, which can thicken the SEI layer, increase in the internal resistance, penetrate the separator and cause internal short circuit (ISC). Also, the deposited lithium may also react with the electrolyte to form a solid deposition of lithium carbonate (Li2CO3), which results in internal cell resistance increase and capacity loss.
  utter_overcharge_impact_cathode:

  utter_overdischarge_impact:
  - text: During overdischarge, the anode becomes over-delithiated and the SEI will decompose releasing gasses including carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methane will be generated, leading to considerable swelling of the battery. Also, once the anode potential exceeds the dissolution potential of copper, the copper anodic current collector will dissolve as Cu2+ ions, which can migrate through the separator, deposit on internal cell components, form copper dendrites and even induce ISC.
  utter_ESC_meaning:
  - text: ESC means a low resistance path to connect the cathode and anode current collectors electrically is formed outside the battery.
  utter_ESC_causes:
  - text: ESC can be caused by either mechanical abuse such as deformation during car collision or electrical abuse such as electrolyte leakage from swelling due to gas generation during overcharge.
  utter_ESC_impact:
  - text: Although the heat generated on the external circuit does not heat the battery and the highest current is restricted by the li-ion diffusion in the electrolyte, the heat generation from side reactions such as the electrolyte decomposition during ESC could still lead to fast temperature rise and even thermal runaway.

  utter_therm_abuse_cause_ISC:
  - text: At high temperatures the separator shrinks or even collapses resulting in ISC.

In the process of battery design, management, operation, and maintenance, the rich knowledge representation contained in the virtual space can be used to simulate and portray the real process of the battery with very high fidelity.
  utter_unusable_nicd_growth:
  - text: With nickel-based batteries, the unusable part of the battery is often the result of crystalline formation, also known as 'memory'.

This is 1.2 M (1.2 moles per litre) solution of lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiFP6) in a mixture of ethylene carbonate and ethyl methyl carbonate. Typically, some additives, like vinylene carbonate (VC), are used in order to improve the formation of stable and ionically conductive passive layers on negative electrodes (the so-called SEI).
  utter_electrolyte_conductivity:
  - text: The LiPF6 electrolytes has a conductivity slightly exceeding 10 mS/cm at room temperature.
  utter_LiPF6_oxidation_potential:
  - text: Electrochemical stability of > 4.8 V versus that of the Li/Li+ redox pair, which is sufficient for the presently used cathodes based on Li1-xCoO2.
  utter_LiPF6_electrolyte_decomposition_temperature:
  - text: This electrolyte undergoes decomposition above 70◦C.
  utter_LiPF6_reaction_water:
  - text: LiPF6 is very sensitive to traces of water—hydrolysis reactions take place, resulting in the emission of harmful hydrogen fluoride.
  utter_define_electrolyte:
  - text: An electrolyte is by definition a substance that upon dissolving in a polar solvent forms a system in which there is freedom of ionic movement. Thus, ionic conductivity is possible. These days such a definition is too narrow, as we now know that not only polar solvents but also weakly polar solvents enable freedom of ionic movement. Polymer matrices can achieve it too, as well as molten salts. That is why in electrochemical or battery jargon, the whole system containing ions and in which ions can move freely is called an electrolyte. Thus, an electrolyte for lithium-ion (Li-ion) cells is not only the lithium salt but the whole system, including the solvent and/or the solvent mixture as well as possible additives.
  utter_electrolyte_influence_battery:
  - text: The electrolytes influence the storage and operating temperatures, limited directly by the thermal stability of the electrolyte, both in the case of solvents and salts. It also influences charge-discharge cycle efficiency (ratio between the energy taken in during charge and the energy retrieved during discharge), affected directly by electrolyte conductivity and lithium cation transference number and possibly affected by the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer resistance.
  utter_different_li_chemistry:
  - text: Lithium Cobalt Oxide(LiCoO2)-LCO, Lithium Manganese Oxide(LiMn2O4)-LMO, Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide(LiNiMnCoO2)-NMC, Lithium Iron Phosphate(LiFePO4)-LFP, Lithium Nickel Cobalt Aluminium Oxide(LiNiCoAlO2)-NCA, Lithium Titanate(Li2TiO3)-LTO
  utter_best_chemistry:
  - text: NCA is the best in terms of storing the more capacity compared to other chemistries i.e., highest specific energy. Because adding aluminium to the lithium nickel oxide gives more stability to the chemistry
  utter_reason_for_low_capacity:
  - text: One of the main reasons is formation of SEI (Solid Electrolyte Interface) on anode.
  utter_reason_for_low_specific_power:
  - text: LMO and LFP are more preferable due to their lower internal resistances. These chemistries also give high thermal stability.
  utter_more_longevity:
  - text: LTO has more lifespan even though it has low capacity.
  utter_popular_chemistry_mobile:
  - text: LCO is the popular choice in mobile phones and laptops.

  utter_li_voltage_at_full_charge:
  - text: Li-ion with the traditional cathode materials of cobalt, nickel, manganese and aluminium typically charge to 4.20V/cell. The tolerance is +/-50mV/cell. Some nickel-based varieties charge to 4.10V/cell; high-capacity Li-ion may go to 4.30V/cell and higher.
  utter_at_full_charge:
  - text: When the battery reaches the full charge, it hits the voltage threshold and the current drops to 3 percent of the rated current
  utter_temperature_rise_during_charging:
  - text: Some Li-ion packs may experience a temperature rise of about 5◦C (9◦F) when reaching full charge
  utter_temperature_rise_during_charging_reason:
  - text: This could be due to the protection circuit and/or elevated internal resistance.
  utter_temperature_rise_above_5_degree:
  - text: Discontinue using the battery or charger if the temperature rises more than 10◦C (18◦F) under moderate charging speeds.
  utter_capacity_change_using_different_charger:
  - text: Some lower-cost consumer chargers may use the simplified “charge-and-run” method that charges a lithium-ion battery in one hour or less without going to the Stage 2 saturation charge. “Ready” appears when the battery reaches the voltage threshold at Stage 1. State-of-charge (SoC) at this point is about 85 percent, a level that may be sufficient for many users. Also, Certain industrial chargers set the charge voltage threshold lower on purpose to prolong battery life.
  utter_lead_acid_application:

  utter_li_advantage:
  - text: The advantages are lower cycle cost because of longer life, lower maintenance and Li-ion can be left at any state of charge without adverse side effects.
  utter_need_full_discharge:
  - text: An occasional full discharge is needed in Nickel based batteries to prevent memory effect.
  utter_memory_effect:
  - text: Nickel cadmium batteries would remember how much energy was drawn on previous discharges and would deliver the same amount on repeated discharges. If more was demanded, the voltage drops abruptly as if to protest against imposed over time.
  utter_prevent_sulfation:
  - text: Lead acid batteries require a saturated charge to prevent sulfation.
